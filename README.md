# Everything Data Mentorship Program Cohort 4 Analysis

## 1. Project Overview  
This project analyzes the **Cohort 4.csv** dataset to understand participant demographics, motivations, and performance.  
The goal is to identify factors that influence graduation rates and provide actionable recommendations for improving future mentorship cohorts.

---

## 2. Workflow  
The analysis followed a structured, multi-step process to ensure data integrity and derive meaningful insights.

---

## 3. Project Objectives  

### 3.1 Data Collection and Cleaning  
- Imported the raw CSV file into **Excel** and **SQL** for cleaning.  
- Identified and removed duplicate entries.  
- Addressed missing values, especially in the **Total Score** column, through row removal or imputation.  
- Standardized categorical data (e.g., *Age Range*, *Track Applied For*) for consistency and accuracy.  

### 3.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Used **SQL queries** to explore the dataset and answer key questions:  
  - Average score by track.  
  - Most represented countries.  
- Discovered patterns, distributions, and relationships between variables.

### 3.3 Dashboard Development  
- Built an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to visualize insights.  
- Included the following sections:  
  - **Demographics**: Distribution of participants by age, gender, and country.  
  - **Track Distribution**: Breakdown of participants by data track.  
  - **Performance Metrics**: Relationship between learning hours, prior experience, and final scores.  
  - **Graduation Trends**: Graduation rates across demographics and performance levels.  

### 3.4 Insight Report  
- Summarized findings from EDA and dashboard analysis.  
- Highlighted correlations such as the link between **aptitude test scores** and **graduation success**.  
- Offered data-driven recommendations to improve future cohorts.
